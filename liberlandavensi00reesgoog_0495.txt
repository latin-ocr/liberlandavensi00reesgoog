under the same excommunicationes the first yoke of pen·
auce had not been observed by him While he remained
in the same transgression and excommunication, before the
end of the year, St. Oudoceus, the Bishop of very eminent
life, migrated to the Lord. He was succeeded by Barth-
gwyn aa Bishop of Llandnffl and Kiug Morgan, and also
Gwaednerth, with a great many chieftains of Glemorgan,
seeing the crossen and relies, with the bella, lying on the
ground, requested him at Idandaff to grant pardon to the

· fratricida Gwaednerth, and to discharge the excommuni-

cation by lifting up the crosses and relics of the saints
from the ground. Aster these things Gwaednerth, pro-
mising, with shedding tears aud great devotion, amendment
of life, with the additiones tasting, prayer, and almsgiving,
was absolved hy the Bishop, and lull penante enjoined to
him suitable to his crime.

Asterwards Gwaednerth, being mindful of the divine

saying, “As water extinguishes fire, so does almsgiving sin,’'
granted to God, and to St. Dubrioius, St. reiro, and St
Oudoeeus, and in the haud of Bishop Berthgwyn, and all
his successore of the Chureh of Llandaff, Llan Oadwaladr,

¹ It ishars statedthatBerthgwynsucceeded Oudoceus as Bishop chlandaff,
which is certainly correct, although hy following the order in which Barth·
gwyn iaherein placed, chwin fell into the error of catering him in his Liat
ol Bishops, as the fourtsenth Prelate, and successor to Gracielis, which has
occasioned some authors considerable perplexity respecting the period ol the
ahora Synod‚ which difficulties might have been obviated had the compilor
of the Liber landavensis not misplaced tha proceedings of tha time of
Berthgwyn after those cf Grecielis. 'l'ha names ol the kings and witnessos
to the granta to Oudooaus and Berthgwyn, being inmany instanees thesemo,
prove that the latter Bishop must have been contemporary with tha former3
and in the 12th section ol this Chapter it is distinotly stated that Grecielis
was Biahop along time after Barthgwyn. This Chapter would hare been
more chronologically arranged had it been phaed immediately altar the
Fourth Chapter, which contains an wcount of prooeadings in the time of
St. Oudocaus.
