David’s, as well as that of Llandaff· ‚ that St . tTeilo, having
snccoeded St. David as Archbishop, on his death, obtained
in addition to his jurisdiction over the diocese of Llandaff,
which he held as its Bishop, also that over st. David’s, as
appears from the numerous churches dedicated to him in

of that Church were disposed to consider a portion of the
