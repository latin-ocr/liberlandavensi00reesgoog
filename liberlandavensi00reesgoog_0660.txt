aud apostolioal benediction. Our venerable brother Ur-
11611, Bishop 61 Llandaff, for the obtaining 61 justice to bis
Ohurch, came twice with great fatigue to the apostolical
See. And afterwards 116 was summoned by our predeces-
sor 61 blessed memory, Pope Honorius, that on the next
festival of st. Lulre,² he should come to the apostolical
See, to answer thee respecting the diocesan boundaries
But 66 he, by means of letters and messengers, signified
that 1161166 weighed down by 6161111666, old age, and po-
verty, and asserted 11161 therefore 1161166 not ableto come
at the appointed time, we have had compassion on him,
and, with the advice 61 6111 brethren, 11616 granted him an
indulgence for not coming to Rome for three years from
this midlent. Therefore, in that term, thou maycst come
before our presence, prepared to answer respecting Llan-
deilo fawr and its oppurtenances, and Lloudeilo Pimpseint,
Caercoiau, Pentwyn, and Llandeilo Penllitgart, and 111611-
