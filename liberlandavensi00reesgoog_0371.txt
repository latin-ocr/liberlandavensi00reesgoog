and Maximian Herculius in the West, ordered theohurohes
to be plundered‚ and the Christiane to be persecuted, and
slain. Which perseeution was the tenth after that of Nero,

Fol. Vol. Ι. pp. 20, 21. But to this perseeution, ecclesiastioal writers have
fixed different dates; some agraeing with that mentioned in this book, viz.
tha year 286, and others rixing on the year ³03, when Diocletian was the
eighth and Maximian the saventh time consula-Stillingdeet's Orig. Brit.
