17. In the Introduction tothe ‘'‘Dictionary of the Welsh

Language,” by Dr. W. Owen Pughe, published 1111832,

v we have the following particulam, “The most ancient

“Welsh Vocabulary is a short Welsh and Latin one in

r “the Boon or Lusrvnsv, in the British Museum, s valu-

“able manuscript of the twelfth century. See Cott. MSS.
“ Vespasian XXV. 2.” Respecting which it may be said,
that the Vocabulary, instead of being Welsh, is Cornish,
in which are many British words disused by the Cornish,
but understood by the Welsh.—Lhuyd‘s Archaeologia
Britannica, p. 4. And it may be further observed‚ that
the contents of this manuscript, besides this Vocabulary,
consist of a Latin-Welsh Calendm, in which Welsh
Saints are principally mentioned, end the Livcs of six-
teen Welsh Saints.-In addition to the printed works
which have reference to, and contain quotations from this
work, the Editor deems it appropriate to give an account
of those MS. Collections which are corneto his knowledge,
that have quotations from it.
