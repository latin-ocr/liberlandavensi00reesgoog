¹ Urhan rs called ιιι the Welsh Chionides, Gwrfau, where he rs also re-
presented asbeing celebrated for his wisdom and liberality, as well as for
his munificenee ιιι beetowing honourable endowments upon the Cathedral of
[landam and upon various Moussten'es which had been pillaged during the
wars of Iestyn son of Gwrgun and Robert Fitz Hammon. Itis also stated
that hewse an active and vigorous suppressuras all evil and viciens prac-
tices and customs, and was a most conciliatory arbitrator in all contentione,
the effect of which was, that his diocese became more peeccable than any
other part of wales-Myr. Arch. II. 556.

The three following Chapters of this Work hear ample testimony of the
indefatigable zeal of Bishop Urban, iu his strenuous efforts ιο restore the
Diocese of Idandaff ιο its original state. Although unable to retain
possession of those territories in the dioeemes of St. David’s and Hereford,
which he considered ιο hare belonged to Handaff, he appears to have been
mesembrl in raising ιο a state ol prosperity the revenues of his see from the
poor and miserable condition to which, through the negligeucs and inability
of his predecessors, they hed been reduced. By these means, with thesides
other resoureea, he was enabled tc rebuild the Cathedral of Llandsff, which
had become almost a heap of mins during the disastrous wara in the con·
quest of Glumorgau by the Normuns. It isuncertain what might have been
the issue of the disputo respecting the territories of the dioeoee, had Urban
lived ιο see its conclusion, which, however, wss not permitted him, as he
was eut off by death when travelling “beyond the seas,” in his fourth
journey ιο Rome, in the tlth year of his age, and in the year 1133.

the Book.
