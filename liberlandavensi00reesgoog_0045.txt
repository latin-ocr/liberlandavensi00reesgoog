aforesaid, which was then removed 10 aug, and in the
possession of Col. Vaughan, the proprietor 3130 01 Η33-
gwrt, and his lineal descendant. Permission, aud oppor-
tunity for collation having been kindly obtained, it was
3003 discovered that the text of this MS. 1133 13 a much
more satisfactory 31313 than that of the Jesus Collega
copy. 111133 3133 found to confirm many of Mr. Black’s
suggested emendations, and authorized, iu addition, several
other evideut improvements; but it was not faultless, and
the Jesus Collega MS. was sometimes more accurate,

³ and Mr. Black’s suggestions were iu some cases still more
¹ correct than either. The Editor has thought proper to

mention the variatione 31 the bottom 01 the page, where

basis 31 the text for the proposed Publicati0n‚ the Editor
observes, thatin preparing 3 fresh copy for tha Presa no
alteration whatever was made in the arrangement of the
several articles, and that the whole 01 the work was writ-
ten verbatim, without anything being omitted or added,
except merely supplying the punctuation and marking the

y aforesaid variation of the text in the notes at the bottom

of the page, and placing the words Lmnn Lunnavmvms

ι 31 the top, whereas some peges 31 the MS. had the names

of the Bishops to which their subjectmatter refened,
there written3 the heading titles of the Sections are the
same, without tho addition of any new 0333 where they

might be wanted3 and the length of the paragraphs also
the same 33 13 the Latin original.

f same strict regard to the original arrangement of the
· articles, aud to other minor particulars, has not been ob·
t ser-ved, bnt such Editorial alterations have been intro·
