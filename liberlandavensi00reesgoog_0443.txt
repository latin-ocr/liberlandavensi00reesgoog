V. When Einion, King-of Glewyssig,¹ hunted among
the rocks and woods of the river Wye, as 110 110000000-
tomed to do, he wondered greatly how and what course the
stag was taking, as it was pursued by the dogs with the
noise of horus and huntsmen through the vailies3 but
the divine protection preserved it throughout, 00111 11
reached the cloek of St. Oudcceus3 when lying, it rest-
ed and recovered its breath, and was safe, as one who
had come to a harbour after suffering shipwrecln or who¹
had suoceeded to joy after sorrow. The huntsmen rc·
mained afar off, with the dogs, mute and stupified, and
being astonished, they now with knees bent 10 the Lord,
regarded as a neighbour and friend, what they hed before
pursued as an enemy.

VI. St. Oudoceus, aman full of age and discreet ma
turity, who servcd God on the brook Caietan, near the
river Wye, without his cloak, on which the stag lay, and
which procured him sefety and protectiou‚ had regard to
the gentle beust, which the power 01 God had tamed; end
King Einion and the hunters, with great astonishment,
and with bended knees, and hands lifted up towards
heaven, asked pardon 01 the Lord and 81. 00100000, with
great devotiones ifthey hod committed some crime.
First of all the King gave him quiet possession of the
stag3 afterwards he gave all the territory which he had
gone round during the whole day, following the track
01 the stag, to God, and to 81. Dubrieius, 81. Teilo, and 81.
Oudoceus the Bishop‚ and 10 all the Bishops of Llandaff
for ever3 the aforesaid traok over mountains, brooks, and
rocks, dividing for ever the territories of the ehurch.
