“ be of no manner of consequence, but only some few un-
“ digested Notes3 very little concerning this Church, but
“relating to the general history of theKingdom.’' Bishop
Nicholson was likewise deceived with respect to the value
¹of this MS. for in his English Historical Library he says,
“There is another Book in the same [Cottonien] Library‚

“that affords a History or Chronicle of this Church, [lalan-
“daffi] which seems to have escaped the notice of both

· “the diligent antiquaries, [Sir Henry Spelman and the

“ Rev. Mr. Wharton] It commences at Bmte, and ends
“A.D.1370.’' In the Cymmrodorion Catalogue of Welsh
MSS. in the British Museum, it is described as being, in
Welsh, 38 pages, then in Latin, 30 peges—The Book was
examined for the Welsh MSS. Society in 1839, and it was
found that the Welsh consisted of a sort of Commentary
on the Apocalypse, a Life of St. David, of St. Gatharine,
and of St. Margaret, and the Latin Chronicle had but a
few particulare of ancient British History. This work
had from its title misled people to consider it the Lrnnn
Launavnnsm, as it contained a good deal of Welsh, which
they, not understanding, erroneously concluded it to relate
to lalandaff. It however refers to this Work, for after giv-
ing some account cf the re-building of the Church of Llan-
daff with the consent of the Kin'g of Glamorgan, and the
honourable endowment of it by him with various territo-
rieS, rents, and privileges, it is added, “as is fully related in
“the Book of Teilo,'’ as before mentioned. The whole of
this Chronicle as far as it relates to Llandaff, is inserted
in the Appendix to this Work. Besides these several
MSS. said to be in the British Museum, ΜΓ. Willis says,
‘⁶ In the Custody of the Chapter of Llandsff are, as Iam
“ informed, only three Books, one of which is a large pa-
“per Book, wherein their Chapter Acts are registered;
“this Book was began to be made in the year 1573.
“Another Book is, I am told, the old Register, or Lmen
“ Launavnnsrs, referred to in the Monasticon called Tilo,
“said to be compiled by Bishop Urban. And the third
“ relates to some orders made by Bishop Blethin.''
