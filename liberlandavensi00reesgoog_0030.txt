tion which he has met with of such copies, is of one being
in the Church of Llandaff in the beginning of the seven-
teenth century, which is mentioned by Bishop Godwin in
his “catalogue of the Bishops of Llandaff,” and respect-
ing which he says, as before mentioned, that the Church
of Llandaff had a Book of venerable antiquity, which was
written upwards of five hundred years ago.

2. The mention of this copy which next occurs, is inan
article in Lincolu's Inn Library, (No. 34,) in one of Sir

· Matthew Hals’s MSS. a volume of miscellaneous extracta

on historic matters, by the celebrated Mr. John Selden.
It contains two extracta from MSS. of the Lrann Lanos-
vanam, of which the second is stated to have been taken
from an ancient MS. lent to Mr. Selden by Theophilus,

4. Mention of this MS. seems likewise to be made by
Sir Henry Spelman‚ in his “concilia” aforesaid; abook
which was published in 1639, the same year astho pre-
ceding by Bishop Usher. Sir Hemy calls it, “The Book
“of Llandaff,” and “The very ancient MS. of the Ohurch
