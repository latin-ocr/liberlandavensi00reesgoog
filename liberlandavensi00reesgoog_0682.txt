And with respect to the said Book, Dr. George Hiclns
in the third volume of the said Thesaurus of ancient
Northem literature, wrote—“These words brielly relate
to St. Teilo, to whom was given the Latin Book of tho
Gospels, many ages before it was the property of the

Ι Churoh of lichfield. Cingal, the Briton‚ from whom it

was bought, sold it, (which perhaps had been taken with
others, while war raged, from some English monastery
adjacent to Wales) to Gelhi‚ the son of Arihtiud, who
gave it to St. Teilo, from which Churoh, when war again
raged, some Englishman perhaps took it, and dedicated it
to St. Ohod. But howsoever this matter may be, Sirownnn
has written many things out of it, from which several ex-
tracts not dissimilar, may be seen iotha third volume, and
188th‚&o. pages of the ‘⁶ Monastioon Anglioanum‚” which
the immortal William Dugdale transcrihed from the MS.
Register of the Ohuroh of Llandaffi² ”
