12. In Nicholl's Antiquities of Lantwit Major, written
in 1729, and inserted in the Appendix to Williams’ His-
tory of Monmouthshirc, published in 1796, he mentions
the Lmnn Lrunrvmsrs by name at the oommoncement
of the article, and calls it a very old manuscript, in which
were found many accounts of the Abbots of Lantwit. He
again refers to it, and calls it, The Book of Llandall3 and
reference is made to it by him a third time, when it is
called a manuscript, six hundred years old, and the first
part older yet by much. And in the conclusion is a quo-
tation in Latin, from the lleadings of the Life of St. Du-
bdcius, extraoted from the Lmnn Lnnnrrvnusm by name,
in which it is mentioned that St. Dubricius visited the
place [Abbey] of St. Iltutus, in time of Lent, for the pur-
pose of correcting what wanted amendment, aud confirm-

5 ing what were to he continued.

13. Bishop Tanner, who died in 1732, mentions in his
‘⁶ Notitia Monastica” many particulars of the Churoh of
Llandalf, of its early history, of the death of St. DubriciuS,
of the seizure of its rovenues by the Saxone, and the
number of its Cauons being in consequence reduced from
twenty four to two; of the several Synods held under Bi-

shops Oudoceus, Gwrwan, Berthgwyn, Cereuhir, Cyfeil-

iawg, Pater, Gulfrid, ngan, J oneph, and Herwald, and res·
pecting the disputc between the Bishop of St. David’s and
the Bishop of Llandaff, relating to the boundarier ol their
dioceses3 all which are by the author mentioned, with re·
serenoes to Dugdale's Monasticon, Spelman’s Consilia, and
Wharton's Anglia Sacra, but which were doubtless origin-
ally taken from the Lrann Lnunnvnnsls. References are
also made to the MS. extraots of Briau Twyne, from the
Lmnn Lnnnrvnnsm, in the Library of Corpus Christi

, College, Oxford, and to extracts, evidently from the same

Work, in Corpus Christi college, Cambridge. Mention

³ is also made therein of the ancient Register of Llandaff, in

the possession of Richard Davies, Esq, of Llanemh, in
the county of Denbigh3 and of the notice by Browne

Willis, of the Work being in the Cottonian Library, and
ἵ in the Library of Jesus College, Oxford.
