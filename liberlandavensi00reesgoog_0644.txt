year to the clemency of the apostolic see, didst asse
that thou hadst laid a complaint against Bernard, Bishr

presence of brothers William‚ Archbishop of Canterbur
Legate of the apostolic see, and the Bishops of · Englan

of our brethren being communicated, on receiving the te
timony of two witnesses we have invested thee with th
portion of the diocese whereof complaint was made, br
saving the right of the churohes ol St. Darid’s and H‹
reford.

known· and disoussed‚ we might render justice to eac}

persons who should conduct their cause in our presence

didst present thyself in our sight ready with witnesses; an
we, having for some time waited for those who were invi
ted, took the oaths of six witnesses, two of whom, that is
a certain intelligent priest‚ and a layman, swore that thy
portion, respecting which the lawsuit had been instituted
that ie, Gower, Kidwelly‚ Contrebyohan, Ystradyw, and
Ergyng, was contained within the bounds of the diocese
