V. And when a oertoin prinoel of that impious nation
had arrived from the seaport, and by murdering the unfor-
tunate inhabitants, and bumingthe houses and ehurehes of
the saints, prooeeded as far as the eity of St. David’s3 he
here stopped, and built himself apalaoe. And when he
beheld the probity of the life of St. Tafis, and St. David,
and of other servants of God, who lived with them, henot
only enried them, as it is always the eustom of the wioked
to envy the good, but also because he saw them so atten-
tive to the service of God, said many reproaehful things of
them, that he might separate them from Christ. And
as he oould not effect what he wished by threats, and
bad langnage he endeavoured to tempt them by various
schemas, and thought that it eonld not be better effeated
than by the blandishments of women.

VI. He therefore ordered his housekeeper to send her
female servants to the holy men, and offer themselves to

their sight, that by their immodest deportment, and their
meretricious blandishments, they might endeavour to with·
draw the minds of the holy men from their holy' purpose.
Who, whilst they executed the orders of their mistress,
and oounterfeited madness, became really mad, as it
is said, “He that aots in afilthy manner, deserves to be-

“oome more filthy.'' Which the aforesaid perseeutor, and
all his family observing, they‚.by the favour of the servants
of God, received the eathoho faith, and were baptized by
them in the name of Christ. He therefore was blessed,
who perseeuted the just knowingly to become just ignorant-
ly, who tempted holy persons so aa to become holy, who
quarrelled with men to become reeoneiled to God, who
despised the humble so as to take delight in humility.
