ed the Menor of Gerthbenui, ae fer as the black Marsh be-
tween the wood, and field, aud water, and the property of
King Gysteuuyu, his father-in-leW, beyond the river Wye,

oth century, end wss so celebrated, that scholare floclred to it from all ports
of Christendom, among whom were the sons of the British nobles, and foreign
princes, besides numerous others, smounting st one time to more then two
thousand pupils. For the accommodatiori of this large number, there were
no lese than four hundred lodging apartments, end seren large hulls or col-
leges. The course of instruction sdopted by St. llltyd, embraced, not only
such sacred and profane literature ns wns requirite for clericel education, but
elso included husbendry‚ and other uselul arta. For many generations, this
seminury continued to be the University of Britain, end to he frequented by
the most illustrious persons of all countriea, till its rerenues were transferred

¹Llsngystennyn Garthbenni in Ergyng. This churoh wns in Herelord·
chire, bnt its situation is not known, aa it has become ruirrated, or, which
ismore probable, hm changed its neme. It was probably founded by Cys-
tennyn or Constantino, iether-in-lsw of Pebisn ab Erb. But whether
this Cystennyn can be identified es either Cystennyn Gomeu, a Cornieh
Chieftnin of the curly part of the oth century, or his contemporary, Cys-
tennyn Fendiguid, who was a sainted King in Britain soon after the depar-
’ ture of the Romans, munet be determined; but from the enomerance of
the followinggrant of Llnngsrniw, or the Church of the Corniahmsn, being
made by Pebiau, it may be prosumed thet he and Cyatennyn Gorneu were
the same person.
