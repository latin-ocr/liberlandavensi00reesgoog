aa-VILLAGE OF GUHBLEJ

During the reign of Meurig son of Ithael, King of

Glewyssig‚ Ili son of Cynllws and Oamawg met together
at the monastery of Llandaff, andin the presence of
Bishop Oerenhir', and his clergy, confirmed their peace,
both swearing upon the altar of Peter the apostle and of
St. Dubn'oius, st. Teilo‚ and st. Oudoceus, the holy gos·
pels and the relies of the saints being placed before them,
that their ancient enmity was done away and forgotten.
After an interval of some time, he who stood with joy in
the presence of God in the heavenly paradise, and pre-
sumptuously said, “I will fix my seat in the north, and be
‘⁶ like the Most High,’' and falling through the effects of
envy and pride, drew with himself from the highest throne
to the bottomless pit, part of the unclean spirits, who
agreed with him, and part he sent into the air: and who
through artfnl fraud deceived our first parent Adam, who
hythe word of God was created eternal and holy, and was
placed in the seat of delights, with supreme happiness and
joy, and having lost his happy stote, was with his wife
cast out of paradise destitute and sorrowlirl; he, the same
ancient enemy, the incitement to enyy still remaining,
caused his offspring, the aforesaid persons, to disagree,
and break the peace, so far that Ili, a member of Anti-
christ, slew Camawg treacherously, committing at the
same time both murder and pery'ury.

After these things, the report of his wickedness
and impiety was heard throughout the kingdom, and

¹ Gwlyb-le, or Wct Plnce ; there being no boundaries given, the situation
of this place hns not been ascemnined.
