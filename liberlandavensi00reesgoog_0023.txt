‘⁴ Urban, Bishop of thet See, about the commencement of
“the twelfth century. The Archives of Llandeff oontain
“a very neat copy on parchment, lately transcribed, but
“more elegantly than accurately written, the handwriting
‘⁶ of the ancient Book being preserved. And there is
“another copy in the library of Jesus College, Oxford.
“'l'be Work contains some Charters of the Ohurch of
“Llandaff, written in the Welsh Language‚ which ere
“understood but by few, on account of their antiquity.''²

Davanam a short account of some Privileges of the Cburch
of Llandaff, the beginning of which he gives as well aa
