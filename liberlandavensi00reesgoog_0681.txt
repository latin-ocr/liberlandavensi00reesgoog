Church of Llandaff in Wales before it came to the Ohurch ⁸

“And of these Annotations I have received Explans
tions1in letters sent to me by the very learned and skilful
cultivator cf British Antiquities, Mr. Edward Lhuyd, the
very worthy keeper of the Ashmolean Museum in the

“Thus far with respect to the Annotations written by
Welshmen in this Book, which is venerable on account of
its antiquity; the first of which by Gelhi‚ who gave it to
the Ohurch of Llandaff, is written in nearly the same hand
as the Book in the Bodleian Library, which is marked

follow seem to be not much more modern, not only on

account of their antiquity, but because it is manifest from

another MS. ΒοοΙς2 of the said Ohurch of Llandaff, that
Libiau‚ the fourth Bishop of Llandaff from Nywys, men·
tioned in these Annotations, died in the year 929.”

“which possibly may he eleven hundred years standing. Ιι has besides

same work-And in a letter to Humphrey Wanley, dated Feb. 8, 1703,
he says, “I never saw any Welsh writing near so old ss that you sentme
