a-GRANT OF RHYDDERCH SON OF ΙΕΒΤΥΝ.ς

Rhydderch 00001 Iestyn, King 01 Glemorgan, indeed 01
011 Wales, except the isle 01 1100010,3 which Iego 00001
Idwal kept for himself3 this Rhydderch‚ I say, was 0 pacifie
and mild man, who granted to both the clergy and leity
of his whole kingdom, and to the widows and orphans,
their rights and inheritence by both divine and human
lew, end especially to the church of God, and its gover-
nors, that is Bishops‚ and all persons of inferior orders; in
whose time there was no desolation throughout all Wales,
citheron the mountains or the plain, except in three
villeges, which were in a solitary situation. To Llandaff
indeed, and its saints, Dubricius‚ Teilo, and Oudoceus, and

Ι10 the year 1046. The date given in the Myvyrian Archaiology 01
Joseph's death is 1043; he is there represented as having been very eminent
101 piety and learning, and 10 have restored 1110 manner 01 celebrating
Seints' days 10 110 original purpose of prayer and almsgiving3 also, he 10
said 10 have, in the year 1030, prevented any secular work being pursued
on the Sabbath and Holidays, and 10 have compelled his clergy not 10 10101-
fere in any quarrela, but to read end leern the Scriptures, without 100 01
reward.

² Professor Rees, in his “ Welsh.Saints,'’ p. 249, observes respecting this
grant, “ 11101 if it ever took place, it was only 1011110 short reign of Rhy-
dderch ab Iestyn3 for the Dimetian princes, considering him 10 be 00
usurper, took up arms against him, and a battle cnsued, in which he wes
alain, leaving his Principality 10 be divided between the conquerere. Sub-
sequent events prove that they did not confirm his benefactions3 and his
reason for bestowing those possessione upon the see 01 Ilandaff, if grounded
upon the supposition that they once belonged 10 Teilo, must have reated
upon a false foundation, for that Prelate was also the aeknowledged Arch-
biahop 01 Menevia.''

³ Probably the Iele 01 Auglesey is here intended.
