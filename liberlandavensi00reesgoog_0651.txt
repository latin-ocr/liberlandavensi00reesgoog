lde-BHM: OF POPE HONORIUS 11. ADDRESSED ΤΟ HENRY Ι.
KING OF ENGLAND.

Honorius, Bishop, servant of the servants of God‚ to
the venerable Hemy, King of England, health and apos·
tolical bencdiction. We have appointed Midlcnt to be a
term for our brethren Bernard, Bishop of St. David's, and
Richard‚ Bishop of Hereford, that they should come to our
presence, and if they considered that they had anything to
allego against Urban, Bishop of Llandaff, with respect to

the districts, concerning which a disputehad ariscn between
them, they should obtain what justice should dictate, but
they neither came nor sent any persons who should act for
them. We therefore, with the communicated advice of our
Bishops and Cardiuals took the oaths of the witnesses
which our brother Urban produced, who, with touching
the holy gospels affirmed that those five districts, namely,
Gower, Kidwelly, Contrebychan‚ YstradyW, and Ergyng,
were contained within the bounds of the diocese of Llan-
daff, that is, the rivers Wye and Towy, and that they had
seen Bishop Herwald‚ the predecessor of Urban, for forty
years holding those districts quietly, without any canonical
interruption. Wherefore by canonical authority, we ad-
judge that he and his successore shall have the aforesaid
districts for ever. We therefore command thee, requir-
ing that thou wilt cause to be observcd what hasbeen
adjudged by the holy Roman Ohurch‚ and that thou wilt
permit no injury to be sustained by him with respect to
the aforesaid five districts-Girsu at thc Lateran the 4th
day of April, [lite]
