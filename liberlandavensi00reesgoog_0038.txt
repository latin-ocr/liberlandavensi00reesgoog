which Mr. Nicholl sav, and from which he extractcd
his information, must have been the transcript described
by Lhuyd, which resembled the ancient MS and was
consequently believed to be the same.

4 In the‘ ‘Bibliotheca Britannico-Hibemica,” by Tan·
ner, Bishop 01 St. Asaph, who died 111 1735, which
was published 1n 1748,11111 ment tioned that the author
had seen the Lmen Lnunnvurvsls 111 the possession of
thc Bishops 01 Llandaff, in his time, and that it was the
same book as was used by Spelman3 where he seems to
be under the same mistake with respect to its identity

With respect to which last particular, enquiry has been
made, and the information received is, that the relatives
01 the Bishop, who lived and remained with him until his
death in 1816, never saw or· heard 01 such MS. and that
shortly after his decease, a catalogue was made 01 his hi-
