session be had been informed Mr. Seldcn’s MS. copy of
the Lrnnn Lnuuavsusrs then was, requesting him to use
his endeavours for obtaining the loau of the Book of 111011-
daff, for it bad been long since conveyed to Englaud‚ and
there was not a copy of it in any part of Wales that bc
knevv of. And ii the book would not be lent for his own
trauserihing, of which he was desirous, he wished Mr. M.
Lloyd to enquire whether it could be had, and a person
