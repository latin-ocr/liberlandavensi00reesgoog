aa-GRANT OF LYBIAW AND GWRWAN.

King Clydawg son 01 Clydwyn, when he was in his
kingdom enjoying peace and adrniuistering justice, became
a martyr through his virtue, and had a crown 01 heawenly
glory‚ with the palm 01 carnal chastity. A certain young
woman, daughter of a wealthy man, was in love with him,
and said to those that sought her, that she would many
no one bnt the illustrious Clydawg. 'l'he answer 01 the
girl being heard, and she refusing all persons 11 usual, one
01 the companions 01 the King, because he could not obtain
her, was filled with an evil spirit and intense desire res·
pectingher; and receiving excitement 101 bad conduct 110111
the malignity 01 rashness, and the maline 01 luxury, 011 1
certain day he killed King Clydawg, innocent 11 a lamb,
near the river Mynwy, while he was waiting 101 the meet-

ing 01 1111111111, and meditating with great devotion on
sacred subjects.

On his death, his acquaintance, companions and friends
01 nohlc parentage, having joined oxen to the carriage,
began to take away the body from the place, and to pass
the Mynwy by a ford. And in one part 01 the river the
yokes of the oxen began to break, and the oxen to stand
still, 101 they could not move the body from the place on
account 01 its great weight, and although often fastened
with chains and ropes, yet they were broken to pieces, and
the oxcn, although they were frequently goaded on, would
not move a step, as if a fiery globe opposed them. And all
beholding and wondering, the body remained in the place
which was divinely prepared 101 ἱ1; and the people imme-
diately, on account 01 the excellent life which they had
known the holy man to lead, and his sanctity, and his death
