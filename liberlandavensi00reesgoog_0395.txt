IX. Those things having been seen, heard, and felt, aa
the “Lord is wonderful among his saints,” the Bishop
took a bone of the arm aud handliug it, for great joy put ,
it into the water, and when it was at the bottom of the
water, it moved itself there for the space of more thau an
hour, no one moving it but the power of God. Which
he alone having at first seen, he called the Dean to him,
who was near, that he might see the moving of the bone,
and water, andalao the Chaplain3 as every testimony should
be in the mouth of two or three witnesses3 and they re-
turned thanks to God for so great amiracle. Which being
seen, tho relics of St. Dubricius were, for the praise and
exaltation of the church of God, placed in a tomb suitable
for the purpose, and in the old monastery, before the altar
of St. Mary, towards the north side.

And the aforesaid prelate, of good memory, observing
the small sine of the place, being in length 28 feet, in

each side, of very small size aud height, and 3 porch, ofa
⁴round form, 12 feet in length and breadth, with the ad-
vice of Ralph, Archbishop of the church of Canterbury‚
and all the clergy and people of the same, began to build
a greater monastery in honour of Peter the apostle, and of
the holy confessore, Dubricius, ,Tcilo, and Oudoceus, on
Wedneeday, tho 14th day of April, in the year 1120; and
having received for himself and his church letters of the
