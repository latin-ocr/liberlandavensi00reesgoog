ference 10 those of Llandaff,¹ there is in the account of ἕ
them nowhere greater obscurity, no where more diffi- l
culties‚ and which appear to have been occasioned by ;

our Author not clearly understanding his subject, and

compiling the Work without a careful examination of the 3

nature of his materiale. To remove, therefore, the ob-

scurity and difficulties, with which the subject has been ,

evidently encompassed for ages, and the doubts of authen-

ticity they have occasioned, and to render the Work more ¹
intelligible and satisfactory, ithae been thought proper to 3
gire a Chronological Series of the Bishops of Llandalf at ¹
the end of the Volume? wherein an endeavour is made, by Ῐ
reference to the Kings of the districts, and the Witnesses ‹

mentioned in the Grants given in their respective erae, to
fix the true order of the succession of the Bishops, and the

time when they respectively lived. It will be observed 1
that the succession inferred from the order of the docu· ¹
ments in this Work, and adopted for the most part by 1

Godwin, Leland‚ Enderby, Heyliu, Le Neve, Browne
Willis, and others, who have given lists of the Bishops of
Llandaff, is herein in some respects considerably altered,
and a Chronological List given of them different from
what has been before publishcd. In this list it will be
scen that several of the earlier Bishops, who were deemed
10 have independently enjoyed the See of Llandaff, were
only suffragan or local Bishops, stationed indifferent dis-
tricts of the diocese under Archbishops Dubricius and
Teilo, and of course contemporary with them, and with
each other. In Dugdale’s “ Monosticon Anglicauum‚” last
edition, Vol. VI. p. 1217, it ir mentioned that there was
much uncertainty in the History 01 Llandaff, aa well with
respect 10 what related to the See, as 10 its Bishops, till

ed a Register of the Bishops of Llandaff from Urban 10 the sixteenth cen-

tury.
