¹ The subject-matter of this Chapter commences in the original Latin, at
pege 208, and has reference to particulare which took place when Pater,
Gulfrid, N udd, Cyfeiliog, Libiau, and Gucan, were Bishops of Llandaff.

² This Bishop is called in the Welsh Chroniclea Padurn, where it is stated
that hc died in the year 961, and that Rhodri the son of Morgan Mawr was
appointed his succeaeon in opposition to the will of the Pope, owing to which
circumstance he was poisoned-Myfyrian Archaiology‚ 11. p. 491.

Godwin, in his List of Bishops, placas Paterae atuh Bishop of Llarrdaff,
following Marchlwys who, according to Brut y Tywysogion, died in the
year 943, which is more consistent with chronology thau the position iu
which he is placed in this Work.
