la-eum OF POPE HONORIUS H. ΤΟ wmnmnt, ARCH-
BISHOP 01⁴* CANTERBURY.

Honorius, Bish0p‚ servant of the servants of God,
the venerable brother william, Archbishop of Canterbur
Legata of the apostolic see, health and apostolical ben
diction. We appointed to our brethren Bernard, Bish‹
of St. David’s, and Richard, Bishop of Hereford, Midlei
to be a term, that they should come to our presence, ar
if they considered that they had anything against Urba
Bishop of Llandaff, with respect to the districts, concon
ing which a disputo had arisen among them, they shoul
obtain what justice should dictate; but they neither cam
nor sent persons who should act for them. We, therefon
with the communicated advice of our brethren the Bishopi
took the oaths of the witnesses, which our brother Urba
had produced, who, with touching the holy gospels, affirm
ed that those five districts, namely‚ Gower, Kidwellngar
trebychan, Ystradyw, and Ergyng, were contained withi
the limits of the diocese ol Llandaffi that is, between th
rivers Wye and Towy, and they had seen Bishop Herwalc'
the predecessor of Urban, for forty years possessing thos
districts quietly, and without any canonical interruption
Therefore, by canonical authority, we adjudge that h
and his successors shall have the aforesaid districts fo
ever. Wherelore‚ we command thee, with requiring, tha
thou wilt cause to be observed what is adjudged byth
holy Roman Ohurch, and that concerning tho stoream(
five districts, thou wilt suffer no injury to arise topin-
Giyen at the lateran the 4th day of April, [lma]
