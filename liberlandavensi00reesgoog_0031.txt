conclusive that the ancient MS. had been returned by
Mr. Selden, and was at that timeat Llandaff.

5. The next mention cf this MS. copy is in the first
volume of the “ Monosticon Anglicanum,'’ by Sir William
Dugdale, published in 1655, as before mentioned, in which
a document therein given, is said ιο have been extracted
from every ancient book, which formerly belonged ιο the
Bishop of Llandaff, but was at that time in the possession
of the celebrated John Selden3 and cs the quotations
of the same articles, both by Dugdale and Spelman, afore-
said, refer to the same folios of the book, from which they
extraeted them, it may be inferred that they copied them
from the same MS. Ιι should seem that Mr. Selden had
procured the MS. possibly by purchase, that had been lent
to him before, and which he was desircus ιο obtain on

and which was perhaps the more readily parted with on
account of the sum offered for it, and a transcript in simi·

5 lar characters being executed, which would supply its
place, and be thought by many of equal value, if not con·
sidered to be same, as it seems was subsequently the case.
As Mr. Selden died in 1654, the year before the first
volume of the Monasticcn was published, Dugdale must
have referred to the MS. from having seen it, aud copied
extracta from it in the life time cf Mr. Selden, some time
before they were published.

6. When Mr. Selden died, he left his very valuable and
curicus Library, in which was this ancient MS. to his
Executors, Matthew Hale, John Vaughan, and Rowland
Jones‚ Esquires, which they intended to bestow on the

³ Society cf The Inner Temple, if a proper place were pre-

’ pared to receive it, but this being neglected they gave it
ιο the University of Oxford, and the collection, with some

, few exceptions, was placed in the Bodleian Library in the
month of September, 1659.
