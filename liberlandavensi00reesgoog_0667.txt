Iunonem, Bishop‚ servant of the servants of God, to his ,
venerable brother Bemard, Bishop of St. David's‚ health
and apostolical benediction. Our venerable brother Ur-
ban, Bishop of Llandaff, for the obtaining of justice to his
Church, came twice with great fatigue to the apostolica!
See. And afterwards he was summoned by our predeces-
sor, of blessed memory‚ Pope Honorino, that at the next
festival of St. Luke he should come to the apostolical See
to answer thee respecting the diocesan bouudaries, But
as he, by means of letters and mesaengers, signified that
he was weighed down by siokness old age, and poverty,
and asserted that therefore he was not able to come at the
appointed time, we hare had compassion 011 him, and, with
the advice of ourbrethren, have granted him aninduigenoe
for not coming to Rome for three years from this midlent.
Therefore, in the aforesaid term thou shalt come before our
presence,⁴ prepared to answerrespeoting Llandeilo Fawr and
its appurtenanoes, and Llandeilo Pimpseint, Caercaiau and
Llandeilo Mainaur with its appurtenancea and Llandeu·

deilo Penllwydgarth and Llandeilo Cilrhedin in Emlym
