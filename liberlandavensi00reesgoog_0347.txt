When he had a knowledge of the fertility, and especially
of the sanctity of the place, he commended the sailors to
' Christ, and resolved to lead the life of a hermit, and being
uninstruetedfromhishavingbeenbroughtupwithouteduca·
tion, he daily reaped improvement. Having spent the space

of seven years with areligious community of brethren, and
sometimes in solitude, led a hely, glorious, and chaste life,
with scant fcod, slight clothing, and au emaciated counte-
nance3 he, in the following seven years, when all North
Wales was desclated, dwelt in his hermitage, and had no·
thing for his maintenance, except the support which he re-
ceived, through the providente of God, from the fish of the
sen, and what the eagles, cr, as we may say, augels, brought
to him.

On a certain day, the Teaeher Caradog came to see whe-
ther he were alive or dcad3 and, tohis joy, finding him living,
said to him, “O beloved! who has maintained thee, being so
“completely separated from all mankind? nc one, Ι am cer-
‘⁴ tain, from our country, which is desclated, and for a long
“time estranged from thee through want of communication
“by sea.” These, and other enquin'es having been made,
the good man, who was the most learned of all Wales, being
skilled in the knowledge of both kinds of law, ancient and
modern, descended from a noble family, and eminent in se-
cular learning3 with bended knccs before the holy person,
and with sighs‚ and the shedding of tears, strongly intreated

of the nativas ; not far from it is a singular chapel, or oratory, being a long
arched edifica, withan insulated stone altar neor the eust end ; in this place
one of the inhabitants reads praycrs, all other clerical offices are performed on
the main land, at Aberdaron. The British name Ynys nour, or the Island of
the current, it obtained from the violence of tha current which rages between
it and the main laud3 and tha English name it probably received from the
Saxona, on account of its being a favourita retreat of the Barda, who retired
there, preferring solitudc to the company of founding foreigners.-Pennant’s
'l'our in North Wales, Vol. II. p. 380-384.
