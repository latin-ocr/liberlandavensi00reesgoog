to reason. As our brother Urban‚ Bishop of Llandaff
complains against thee because thou dost permit some ol
his parlshoners of Archenfield to communicate in the
chureh of Hereford, against whom he had pronounced
sentence of excommunicatiom and dost endeavour tu
ordain Bishop, a Prior1 ol his, belonging to his esta·
bilshment, who impudently aspires, as the said Bishop
asserto, to the Bishoprie of Hereford, and communientes
in the same ehnrch as those whom hehas excommunicated.
Therel'ore, we command thee by the present writings that
thou inflict on him no injmyormolestation, nor communi-
cate with his parishioners who have been excommunicated

by him, nor promote his clergymen without his consent.—
Given st Genoa the lntn day ol August, [uso]

ra-nr1srnn OF JOHN, CARDINAL, TO URBAN, BISHOP
OF LLANDAFF.

To his brother Urbnn, the venerable BIshop of Llsnduff,
his brother John, Priest Oerdincl ol the holy Roman
Ohurch, sends health and respect. Inasmuch ns our
Lord the Pope hes not written anything to the King
ol' England respecting your case, it is because he has
not as yet obtained his complete favour, nor the mes-
senger of the Bishop of St. Devid's spoken to our Lord
the Pope, nor mede any mention either of him or his
cause. Goon well. Our advice is that you romain
in your diocese, and do not come to us at present until

you shall hear something more certain respecting our
Lord the Pope, end the King. [uso]
