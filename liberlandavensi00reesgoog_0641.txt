uinformed through means oi report, that contrary to your
honour and the salvation of your souls, you have rashly

dared to plunder your mother, the Church of Llanduffi
and annihilata it. Wherefore, having compassion‚ with

paternal affection, on your adverse conduct, we, by means
of this present waiting, do order and command that ye,
without delay, restore whatsoever in landa, tithes, obla-
tione, sepultures, and other property, ye here unjustly
taken and retain from the said church, and other churches
of the said diocese. For if sons are to be blamed who
dishonour their natural mother, and inflict injmy on her,
much more are they who molest their spiritual one, and
by violence take away her property3 and what is infamous,
and prejudicial to the Christian name, when ye come to
the thresholds of the saints, and the dedicatione of the
churches, ye blush not to rob, and molest, and on the
market days take away the property of those who are
coming or returning, and kill some of them in acmel
manner. On account of these things, we commend that
ye altogether desist from these crimes, and that ye humbly
obey the orders of our venerable brother, Bishop Urban.
But if ye treet them with contempt, We, God being our
adviser, will confirm the canonical sentence, which he

shall promulgate against you-Giton at the Lateran the
l9th day of April, [naa]
