was without 0 degree, was his butler. The olergyman was
desimus to possess the monastery after the death of his
uncle, but fearing lest St. Samson should he unanimously
chosen Abbot on account 01 1010 virtues, and by that means
he should be deprived 01 1100 monastery, he, with his hro·
ther, entered into a deadly dedign. The bretbren 01 that
place having a custom 01 drinking a potion 01 herbs after
mass3 the butler, by the advice 01 his brother, prepared poi-
son, and having skilfully proved itto be mortal, he poured it
into the cup 01 St. Samson3 which he, by the Holy Spirit, un-
derstauding to be the case, blessed 1100 cup, drank it all up,
and felt no ill effecta from it. On the same day after dinner,
St. Samson had some familiar discourse with the butler.
“My dear brother,'’ said he, “May God heal thee 01 every
‘⁴ disorder, because the cup which thou didst give me to-day
“ has produced great henefit 10 my body.‘' Hearing these
things, being repentant, he sighed, and admonished 10101000-
ther, the instigator 01 1100 crime, 10 repent; but he refused.

On the following Suuday‚ when the same clergyman re-
ceived the Holy Communion from tha hands 01 St. Samson,

¹ 100 was that instant seined by the Devil. Being pale, and

tearing himself forthwith, aud gnashing with his teeth, he
said to those who were standing by, “Why do ye stand
“heret IfI did not see Samson my master present, I
‘⁴ should care nothing for you.’' Illtyd, when he saw this,
ordered him to be bound, and led out; but his brother
hearing these things, coufessed the crime 01 both, and be-
sought pardon 01 St. Samson3 aud St. Samson being affert

ed with grief, wept, and having blessed water and 011, di-
rected them tobegivcn him to drink,and therebyhe released
him from the 101100οο0 01 1100 Devil. Therefore it came to
pass, hythe just judgment 01 God, that the primacy, which
be wickedly sought for, he could never obtain.
