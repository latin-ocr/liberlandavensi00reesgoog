at the same time, Edgar, and also Hywel Dda¹ and
Morgan Hen, were Kings of all Britain, and those
two were subject to King Edgar. Morgan Hen
likewise then enjoyed the whole of Glamorgan in
peace and quietness, but Hywel Dda would take
from him Ystradyw and Ewyas, if he could. Which
being made known, King Edger called Hywel Dda,
and Morgan Hen and his son Owain‚ tobis court,
and there, in full council, King Edgar examined the
matter in litigation between the two, and it was
found hythe just judgment of the court of King
Edgar‚ that Hywel Dda had acted wrongfully against
Morgan Hen and his son Owain‚ and Hywel Dda
was deprived of those two districts, that is Ystradyw
and Ewyaa for ever, without recovery. And after·

last work, page 490, it will be found that it was not Howel Dda, but his son
and suocemor Owain‚ who intruded into the dominions of Morgan the Great,
[Morgau Hen,] which is thore stated to have taken place in 958. 'I'he arbi-

tration made by Edgar was most probably one of his first acts after he com·
menced his reign in the year 959.
