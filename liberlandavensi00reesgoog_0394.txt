Sunday, the 231 day of May, he was received into his
churoh 01 Llandaff, when there was a processioa and the
holy crosa, with abundance 01 relies, was carried; and on
whose arrival there was plenty efrain, which was much
wanted by the people, for it had not rained even a drop
for seven weeks and upwards throughout the district of
Glamorgan. On Wednesday, the 2nd day of June, the
aforesaid Bishop of good memory, after the lahour under-
gonc, and on account of the obtaining 01 so great joy
to himself and the church for having procured so great a
patron, and fasting and prayer having been made, called
together his canons, and his brother Esni, who was Dean
01 the same church, and a man 01 chaatity, and very great
prudence‚ and also his chaplain‚ named Isaac, a man 01
great shrewdness and ability. And the sacred relics 01 St.
Dubricius being laid on the ground, were placed together
that they might be prepared, the dust separated, and be

washed with water after so long a journey. Being put with
their own hands, out 01 reverence towards so great treaaure

and the whole country, into three basem before the altar 01
Peter the apostle and the holy confessore Dubricius, Teilo,
and Oudoceus3 immediately, by the touch of the holy re-
lies, the water bubblcd on all sides in a marvellous manner,
as if 3 great red hot stone had been thrown into it.
And they did not only wonder, being amared at the va-
rious ebullitione throughout the whole bacon, but also be-
cause they perceived the water to be very hot. Not only
for ashort time, or the space 01 3 moment, but also, as
longas they were‘altemately moved by them in common in
the water, so long the water increased in heat to the end
of the abluti0n; and not only the sight and touch perceived
this miracle, but the hearing likewise‚ for the sound 01
the bubbling 01 the heated liquid was heard.
