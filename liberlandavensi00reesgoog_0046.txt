dnced, as the Editor conceived would render the Work
more intelligible and interesting 10 the general reader.
01 these, however, the principal one is the transposing
01 the documenta relating 10 the time 01 Urban, the last
Bishop 01 Llandaff mentioned in the Work, from the for-
mer portion, where they were placed, to constitute three
Chapters in the latter part, after the particulare related
01 the other Bishops who preceded him in the See.1 Be-
sides this alteration there is no change in the arrangement
01 the articles, although they might be more chronologi·
cally placed3 and they are left to remain as originally
arranged, that reference to them may be the more easily
made from one 01 the languages to the other. The
Translation is likewise divided into Chapters, with the
contente of each placed at its commencement3 the See·
tions are numbered, and new heading titles given to such

Ι as were without them; the longer paragraphs are divided

into smaller ones, and explanatory running titles given
at the top 01 the page, for the information and conveni-
ence 01 the reader. With respect to the Translation it·
self, the Editor has to observa, that one 01 the professed
objects 01 the Society, being to publish English Transla·
tions, as well aa the original MSS. and many persons hav-
ing become members on such object being announced,
and with the understanding that it would be adhered to,
he has given a Translation 01 the whole Work. He like-
wise thinks proper 10 mention, that his aim in executing
it, was, to give as close a rendering as possible 01 the ori-
ginal Latin in the English language. However, as the
sentences of the writers 01 the age were frequently incon-
veniently long, he has sometimes divided them into shorter

¹For want of observing that the particulare mentioned to have tehen
place in the time 01 Bisho Urban, occurred ata period later than those
recorded at the end 01 the S. Bisho Godwin conc uded that the account
did not extend 10 later than 1110, 01111Ε1111 Erana, aa mentioned in Lewis
Morris' MSS. no later than 1104, the time 01 the death 01 Bishop Herwald‚
whereas it extended to 1132, nearly the death of Bishop Urban, as appears
in 1111 arrangement of 1111 articles in 1111 English Translation.
