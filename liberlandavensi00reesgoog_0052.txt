for his assistance in consulting books at Oxford‚ which
were notin the Editor’s possession; and to Mr. William
Reae, oi Llandovery, for assisting in ascertaining the an·
cient localities, and adjusting the Chronology3 and also to
the Rev. J. Montgomery Traheme, of Coedriglan, Glaq
morganshire‚ for his exertions in endeavouring to obtain
information respecting the ancient MS. copies that remaiu
undiscovered; and particularly to Lady Hali, of Llanover,
Monmouthshire‚ for her zealous and important exertions
in promoting the whole proceeding. Having thus men-
tioned the aid he has received, and the names of the prin-
cipal persons who favoured him with communicatione 111
editing the Work, he feels disposed to advert briefly to
himself, and to say that it has occupied much of his at-
tention ior a considerable time, with a resolution not to
spere any peius, and a wish that it should be as com-
plete as possible; whereby‚ with the assistance he has
received, he hopes a Book has been produced, worthy of
the national and patriotio Society which has caused its
publication, such as will be approved of by its distinguish-
ed Patrons and Members, be satisfactory to the several
Subscribers, and meet with a favourahla general re-
ception.
