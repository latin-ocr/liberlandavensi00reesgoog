I year, is the following notice, L“ibrary of Bryon Cookc,

“,Esq Μ..Ρ for Malt t.on Regest um Landevense3 or Book
“of Llandaff; a very ancient manuscript 111 vellum, con-
“ taining the Lives of elgar, Dubrioiua Teilo, and Oudo-
“ceus3 communicatione between the Papal See and the
, “three first Popish Bishops of Llandaff3 and a Register of
“Bishope from Urban to tho l6th century.” The same
j notice, or rather oopieS, thereos, may be seen in page 285
’ of Vol. I. of Sermonsby the Rev. Richard Dades, Arch-
= deacon of Brecon, published in 1815; andin the List of
Books relating to Giamorganshire‚ at tho end of the vo-
lume entitled Sovrrr Wnnns, or Original Delineations of
that part of the Principality, by the Rev. Τ. ReeS, published
in 1818. This book appears to have been the Llannerch
MS. from its having the list of Bishops described to be in
ι that copy, which is not mentioned to have been in any
other. Further enquiries have been made respecting the
MS. but no information could be obtained, so that its ex-
istence, and the place where it is deposited, aa well as of
the Selden MS. and of the Llandaff Transcript, are at pre·

sent unknown.

VIII. Reference Is next made to the MS. copy of the

Lmen anonvnrvsrs which is in the Library of Jesus

, College Oxford, of which mention is made in Lhuyd's
“Archaeoiogia Britannica,” 1707, p. 259, ao aforesaid, where
