brary, and no trace appeared that it had ever been in
his possession. From which particulam it may be inserted,
that Mr. Edward Williams, who died about 1829, agad
above 80 years, had seen the MS. that subsequently it
became missing, and that when he afterwards asked for it,
he was told it was gone to Calgarth Park, for the purpose
of putting an end to his anquiries, for it appears from the

¹ foregoing account, that it never was there. It may be

further observed, that although several enquiries have
been made respecting this MS. no information relating to

its present existence has been obtained.

VIL—l. The next ancient MS. copy ol the Lmsa
annnvuwsrs to which the Editor will adrem, is the
Lnawwnncn MS. so called because it was for a consider-
able time in the library at Llannerch, Denbighshire. The

first notice which the Editor has met with of this MS. oo· ,

curs in the collection of MS. extracta by the Rev. Brian
Twyne, who died in 1644. as before mentioned, which
are stated to be from the very ancient Book of Llandaffi

ι where it is mentioned that onita left cover there was,

either in brass or copper‚ a picture of Teilo, the Patron of
the Church, holding a book,l and that the first part of the
volume contained the Gospel of St. Matthew‚ which last
circumstance identifies it with the Llannorch copy, as
hereafter mentioned, but whether it was then at Llan-
nerch there is no account.. This Collection of MS. ex-
tracta is in the Library ol Corpus Christi College, Oxford,

χ as before mentioned.

2. The next mention of the MS. is in the “Archaeologia
“Britannica'' by the Rev. Edward hhuyd, published· in
1707, page 259, where, as before noticed the Lrnss
Lawnnvnwsls is said to be in the library of Robert Da-

¹ It appears from this description that the same kind of pertrait was on
the cover of both the Selden and this MS. but here it is more particularly
described aa being on the leit cover, and oi St. Teilo holding a book, as
given in the {rantispieea from the representation in the Hengwrt Tran-
script ssoresai . '
