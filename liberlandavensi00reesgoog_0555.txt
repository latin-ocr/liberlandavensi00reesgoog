Brochwael and Bishop Cyfeiliawg respecting that church

116 clergy and learned men who were between Towy and
Wye, to adjudicate between the Bishop and Brochwael‚
by the true judgment of the clergy 61 116 whole synod,
the aforesaid church, with all its land, was adjudged to

Bishop Cyfeiliawg, and the Ohurch 61 Llandaff for ever.
And the judgment pronounced being acceded to by both

parties, Brochwael said, “I sacrifice to God, and do by cath

thatasCyfeiliawg, 61 Cimeiliauc, called inthe Saxon Chronicle Camelaac, by
Matthew of westminster, 06111166, 611 by Florentius Cimelgeacum, was
Bishop of Llandaff, the district of Archenfield‚ at present in the diocese 61

isstated in the Brut y Tyvvysogion, thatin 116 second year after 01161
Tindaethwy was made King of all Wales, A.D. 756, “There 1166 6 battle
between the Welsh and Saxam 61 Η6161611, in which the Welsh 11616 116-
1611616; 611 1161601161661, Bishcp of Glamorgan, was slain,”-Myv.
Arch. 11. 473. Τ1616 must be soma error in the above date of the death 61
01161661, unless 116 616 16 suppose that he and Gyfeiliawg were not the

same person, which ia very improbable, as there 1616 other Bishop of 11161-
dan recorded having 6 similar name.
