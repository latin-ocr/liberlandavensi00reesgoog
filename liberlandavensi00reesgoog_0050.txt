morgan, were Severeignv of South Walea they probably
through their influcnce in some measure obtained posses-
sion, and subsequently, when the Glamorgan Princev were
no longer the Sovereigns of the whole district, the Dio-

cese of Llandaff may have been deprived of what had been
allowed to belong to it, and perhaps was possessed for a
short time by its Bishops, and the circumstance caused
Bishop Urban to prefer his complaints against the Bishop
of St. David’s to the Papa] See in the following century.
And as the LIBER Lannavnrvsls was compiled by Galfrid‚
the brother of Bishop Urban, who greatly exerted himself
to restore the Diocese of Llandaff to what he deemed its
true boundaries, and recover what he thought it had been
unjustly deprived of, it may be presumed that the compiler
of the Work, which, if not written in direct support of his
brother'a claime, wesin accordance therewith, would adduce
overy document he could to substantiate them, without
making minute enquiry into its authenticity. He· appears
likewise to have written his Work with considerable bias
and partiality iu favour 01 thc See, and of the district, which
may be observed by his calling St. Dubricius Archbishop
of Llandaff, when Caerleon was the Archiepiscopal See,
and he was only Bishop of Llandaff; and his giving the
same title to St. Tcilo‚ when the Diocese of Llandaff was
only part of his jurisdictiou3 and also his calling Rhy-
dderch ab Iestyn King of Glamorgan, Sovereign of all
Wales except Anglesey‚ when he had only obtained the
government of South Wales; to which many other in-
stauoes might be added, and therefore some caution may be
advisable in giving credence to every particular related in
favour of the extent 01 the ancient Diocese of Llandaff.
However‚ with attending to these remarks, and making
an allowance accordingly, probably the historical particu-
lars herein recorded, will be found considerably more
worthy of credit than they may appear on a cursory and
inattentive perusal. What has been advanced on the
subject, by the Author of the “Essay on the Welsh
