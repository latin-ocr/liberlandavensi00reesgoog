isso called because it is the ancient Chartulary‚ or Regis-

ι ter Book of the Cathedral of Llandaff, wherein were re-
i corded Memoirs of its more eminent Prelates Grants of

Eudowment‚ and other interesting and important particu-
lars relating to the Church and Diocese. It has also been
called Lurrn Tunc, or Tun Boon orTn1u0‚ because the
Diocese sometimes went by the name of Teilo, St. Teilo
being one of the most eminent of its Prelatcs, and also
because part of the materiale, whereof it was compiled,
was contained in a still more ancient negusar, thut went
by his name, to which it makes referencc,¹ and which it
probably superseded.

fiid² or Jeffrey, brother oi Urban, the last Bishop of Llan-
daff mentioned therein, whose undertaking appears to be
to make the older Register of Teilo his ground-work, and
to gire in addition such other suitable information as he
could obtain, and think proper to communicate, and to
relate the particulare according to the mode oi description
