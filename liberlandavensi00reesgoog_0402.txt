and the stage, no one driving them, followed. And that
their praying might not be any more interrupted by busi-
ness of the kind, the same wild animals, for a long time
after, by the direction of God, brought wood to them, and
what things were necessary for the use of the holy men.
Who therefore doubts that those persons were holy,towhom
God caused the stags thus to minister? Others may in·
deed kill the wild animale, but they cannot so tame them.
When they approached their residenee, all the inhabitants
of the place met them, and said, “O divine brethren, how

· “manifestly have ye been distinguished this day by divine

“grace, for the irrational brutes have become your ser-
“vants We, therefore, are uuhappy persons, who have
“not obeyed the saints until we are admonished by brute
“animals to obey them.'' In the meantime, St. David
going out of his tent, found before the door thereos, a
book open, which had been ignorantly leit by the brethren,
aud although it rained vehemently, it was altogether un-
injured by the rain. Which he admiring, said, “God
“is wonderful among his saints, and holy in his works.”
And that agood thing might not be stifled in oblivion, but
widely spread abroad, he immediately called the elders oi
the people, that beholding the wonderiirl works of God,
they might render prayers and vows to the Lord, and pub-
lish to men the sanctity of their brethren, because God had
preserved their book from the rain.

That those persons might be more and more distinguish-
ed by miracles, through the faith of Christ, as God caused
water to llow from the rock for the thirsty Israelites, so
he ordered fresh fountains to arise for the thirsty saints;
and as we have heard from old inhabitants of the place,

they who drank of those fountains, asserted that they did
not driuk water, but wine, so pleasant was its teste.
