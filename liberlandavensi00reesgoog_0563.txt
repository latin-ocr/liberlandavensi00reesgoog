away from him hia banquet by force and violence. And
so great an outrage having been committed, the Bishop on
the morrow arose with his family, and left the King under
a malediction and perpetual curse3 and assembling to-
gether all the clergy of the whole diocese, situate between
the mouth of the Taratyr on Wye and the mouth of
Towy, in full synod at Llandaff, caused the King to be
anathematized. And it was told to the King, and to
the Bishop of St. David’s, whose name was Lumberth,8
respecting the curse that had been pronounced. And
after an interval of time, messengers having been sent to
Bishop Lybiau, and received by him, they met together in
the monastery of bannoors. And it was adjudged to
Bishop Lybiau, that he should have live times the velue
of the attendants he had when the banquet was taken from
him, and also seven times the value of the said Bishop,
that is 700 marks of pure gold. King Tewdwr seeing
