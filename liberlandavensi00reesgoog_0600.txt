understand this 1110000100, that the heavenly shepherd,
Christ the Lord, by whose providence aud direction all the
body of the earthly church is ordered aud gevemed, with
bcuntiful compassion, mercifully elected Herwald 10 the
sacerdotal diguity of his Ohurch 01 Llandaffi who had been
crdained Priest through means 01 110 humble imposi-
tion of the hands of J osepn Bishop of Llandaff, and had
remained a considerable time among the English, and
shone in grace and morals aa well before them as before the
principal persons of his own country, that isthe British
nation. Whose election by the invincible Gruffydd, the
powerful mouarch of the Britons, and Meurig son of Hy-
wel, being unanimous, the Prelates, Priests, Doctors, Obicis,
and Nobles, agreeing thaneto, his consecration was hou·
ourably confirmed by the eminent Archbishop Cynisis‚l aud
canonieally completed by many other Bishops of Englaud,
under whose haud, and according 1ο whose rulo, he becanm
Bishop after the manner of his predecessore, the glorious
Lord Edward' King 01 tha Auglo-Saxons, being present,
and all Bishops, and Abbuts, and also Archdeacons‚ with
, all orders 01 the Church, aud learned men, adjudging it 1ο
10 firmly aud surely ratified, aud likewise blessing it in
that famous synod, which was held 01 Londcu in the
Whitsun weeh in the year 1059 from the birth 01 our
Lord J esus Christ, in which council 01 the learned meu,
a decree of this kind was thus pronounced and· confirmed,

¹ Bishop Godwin 010100 that Herwald was consecrated by seigam, Arch-
biahop 01 Canterbury, whose name however bears no resemblance to 6110101.
But as Stigand was not always regarded aa a lagitimete Arehbishop‚ owing
10 the irregular manner by which ha tbrust himself into the aee, 01 which
he was afterwards deprived in 10673 it is more than probable that Kirra,
Archbishop 01 Yorlr from 1050 tolcae, was the Prelate who presided at
the above convocation.

² Edward 111. aurnamed the Confusam, became King cf England in 1048,
and died in 1006.
