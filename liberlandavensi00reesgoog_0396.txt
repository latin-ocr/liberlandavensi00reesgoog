OF THE CHURCH OF LIrANDAFF.

infancy a worshipper of God; nor isit wonderfirl, for
before his infancy, God hed predestineted him to be his
servant3 he predestinated whom he elected, he elected
whom he loved, end he crowned his helovcd with the
victory of a true confession. ΤΙιε man of God therefore
carried on his warfare by being urgent in his prayers to
God, and by giving to the poor all that he possessed.

be his own, and what was nothis own, he caused to he
his own. For leaving nothing remaining to himself of his
own, he gave in exchsnge perishing for eternal things. Ο

God, thet he might receive en hundred fold! Ο precious
