1.-0F THE FIRST STATE OF THE CHURCH OF LLANDAFF. Ι

In the year of our Lord, 156, Lucius,2 King of the Bri-
tons, sent his ambassadors, Elfan and Mcdwy‚ to Eleu-

1'l'he arrangement of the original Text of the Book is hereby somewhat
chsngsd3 the information relatiug to Urban, Bishop of Llandaff, the last
Bishop mentioned therein, being removed to the latter part, and constitu-
ting the last three chapters of the English translation. The subject matter
cf this second chapter commences iu the Latin at the esth page.

lAuthcrs are by no means agreed about the time of the conversion ol
King Lucius. Archbishop Usher cites no less than three and twenty differ-
ent opiuions; Beda, theold Saxon Annnls, and the author of the Anusls of
the Church of Rochester, who floumahed about the year 1224, lix cn the
year 167, in the consulship ol Severus aud Herennianus, and in the eleventh
year of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, when Eleutherius was Bishop ol
Rome3 but Usher dates it nine years later. thwithstanding this differ·
cuce of chronology, that there was such a Christian King aa Lucius about
that time is beyond question; for Nannins, who lived in the begin·
uing of the seveuth century is positive on this point, and the English am-
bussadors at the council ol Constance pleaded Lucins's couversion against
the ambassador ef Castile as an argument for precedeuce. However, it is
evideut from Gildas, and other writers, that Christianity got footing here in
the apostolical age, but what progress it made, in what parts the church
was established, and under whom, what successes or diaccuragemeuta,
what revolutione happened in the Ecclesiastieal Histoi-y of this island from
the time cl the Apostles to King Lucius, is altogether uncertain-Collieffs
Ecclesiastical Histcry, Vol. Ι. p. 12.

ln the Walsh Trisds, Lucius is called Lleurwg ap Coel ap Cyllin, and
Lleufer Mawr3 and in later Welsh Chronicles, Llss ap Coel.
