dreadful 10 relate, killed the Deacon before the altar
of the saints, the blood being sprinkled on the altar and
the walls 01 the church.

111000 evil deeds having been perpetrated, they were
1011110 the Bishop, who then abode with Hywel.¹' the
British King, in the region 01 Brecknock. When he
heard it, he immediately sent messengers to the monas-
teries 01 311 the provinces of the whole diocese between
the mouth 01 Taratyr on Wye and the banks of Towy,
which were subject to the ohuroh 01 Llandaff, and to St.
Dubricius, St. Teilo, St. Oudoceus, and Bishop Pater, and
all succeeding Bishops for ever, that they might assemble
the Priests, 11030011, and clergy 01 311 degrees, and meet
together. Nowi also hearing, with his nobles, that the
malediction 01 the whole ehurch was rushing and falling
upon him, would not dare 10 11111311 such 3 weight 01
malediction‚ but entered into counsel with the most learn-
ed men of his country, and sending messengers, called the
Bishop to him. And afterwards Nowi, and the Bishop,
with his nobles, met together in the city 01 Gwent,² and
hythe advice of 311 the doctors 01 both parties, the six
cruel men were given into the hands 01 the Bishop, and

might receive divine judgment. Also it was fixed, accor-
