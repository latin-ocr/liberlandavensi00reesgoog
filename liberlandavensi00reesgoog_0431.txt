being prolific, he had a son every year in succession3 and
the more they ought to have rejoiced, the more they griev-
ed on account of poverty‚ and having so many children.
He and his wife possessed so much simplieity, that they
sought the advice of St. Teilo respecting their numerous

children and poverty‚ and enquired what was best to be
done in future. Holy Teilo hearing their querulous com-
·plaint, said, “I see no means whereby you vvill avoid
“having a numerous family, but by abstaining from coha-

The wife then conceived, and brought 'forth seven sons3
