And he had there for a companion St. David‚¹ a man of
most perfect liie; to whom he was united by so much love,
and the grace of the Holy Spirit, that in their transactions,
they both had the same thought with respect to what was
to be done, and what to be left undone. Behold, dearly
beloved brethren, how God unitas his saints on carth,
whom he elects to be citizens in heaven3 he chose two,
that by means of two he might choosc many. O blessed
life of these two, through which the souls of many persons
have received resreshment.

V. In the days of those holy men, a certain people, of
Scythia, who, from their painted clothes, or the colour of
their eyes, were called Pica, came in a very large fleet to
Britain; and being seized withadesire of enjoying the land
on account of the plenty of the good things, with which it
then, above all islanda, abounded, invaded the country of the
Britons, more through means of treachery than force, and ’
for some timo exercised very great tyranny orer them.
Noris it wonderful that it was overcome by it; for the
nation oi the Picts were cralty‚ and trained in many en-
gagementsby sea andland3 and the other, although endued
with strength of body, was artless, and peaceable, and not
having been by any one attached, and ignorant of war,
was themora easily subjugated. If any one should be de-
sirous of having a more full account, he will find it in the
History of Gildas, the Historian oi the Britons.

¹ David, or, as his countrymeu called him Dewi, was the son of Sandde
ap Carcdig up Cuneddn, by Non, daughter of Gynyr of Caergawch. He

sidcd, first at Caerleon, and afterwmds at st. David’s, where hc died about
the middle citha oth century .-Reos’ Welsh sunu, p. las-acl.
